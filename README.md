# Yet Another Todo App

Yeah, that's right, another one. But you gotta start somewhere, so ðŸ¤·  
The stack of technologies that are absolutely certain to be used:

- [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js)
- [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript)
- [tRPC](https://github.com/trpc/trpc)
- [Prisma](https://github.com/prisma/prisma) (w/ PostgreSQL)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss)
- [NextAuth.js](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth)
- _... to be continued?_

In fact, there is already a configured stack that uses exactly the same technologies - the [T3 stack](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app).
But it would be much more exciting to explore everything with your own hands, at least for research purposes.
